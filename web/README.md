# Verzameling
Create lists for your collections. 
 
## Getting started
Run `start.bash`

## Deploy using a git hook
Check https://www.denick.org/post/08deploy/

Some extras I use on this project:
- Write the release version to the page footer
- Write the release version to the page footer and include a hyperlink to github
- Reload Gunicorn restart after the deploy

Check the hook [setup/git-hooks](setup/git-hooks)
